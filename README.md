# UCL_CASA_QM_CITY Project

**Description:** This project is part of the CASA Quantitative Methods course. It aims to bolster a theoretical framework for classifying cities along a spectrum based on the extent that they have been affected by economic globalisation.

The analysis centres around clustering. The workflow in this GitHub provides the means of connecting to Eurostate and re-running the analysis with any desired variables for easier extension of this research.
